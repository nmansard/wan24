    "This notebook is a quick recap of the main practical concepts of numerical programming, and introduces the Casadi module of the Pinocchio library:\n",
    "- Pinocchio is obviously a library gathering the main rigid-body dynamics library.\n",
    "- Casadi is an auto-differentiation tools, i.e. you can write symbolic expression and differentiate them. It is also wrapping the IpOpt solver, which is a quite robust and generic constraint-based optimization solver. You can then quickly write a problem with some symbolic expression for the cost and constraints, and Casadi will transfer it to IpOpt for solving it.\n",
    "- The Pinocchio/Casadi module is a part of the Pinocchio solver written by Justin Carpentier which uses Casadi to unroll the algorithms of Pinocchio into symbolic expression, which then can be differentiated. It is a very powerful tool for initiation and prototyping, although it cannot scales to very large problems (in particular whole-body optimization problems) due to various technical problems that we can discuss.\n",

    "- $e_i(q) \\in \\mathbb{R}$: error function for task $i$. In this tutorial our error function is real valued.\n",
